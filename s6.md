#### permission level: permission class - user group other =ugo  +/- permission(rwx)
file - rwxrwxrwx - rwx means -read write run as app
dir -  rwxrwxrwx - rwx means -ls  ,cp mkdir ,.. , cd

chmod - change modification permission

w- is vital permission for file- is default
x- is vital permission for directory- is default
chmod ugo+x = chmod a+x = chmod +x

- permission parent is important than child - is for dir but there is -R is for recursive


permission class with binary - rwxrwxrwx =4+2+1 4+2+1 4+2+1 =777 - full permission

###### special permission
if 0 is not- 

stat file1 - full permission list


root and sudoer can:
chown - change ownershio - user and group owner
chgrp - change ownershio - just group owner

sudo chown zeintiz:docker chawnzizitozeintiz = sudo chown zeintiz.docker chawnzizitozeintiz - chown user,:group , user:group --recursive or -R for all content of directory


##### set default permission for users

umask - 

umask(not) and 666 - for file permission
umask(not) and 777 - for directory permission


or 


base permission for file(666)-umask=final permission for file
base permission for dir(777)-umask=final permission for dir

umask for users default = 002
umask for root default = 022

666-077=600 (-is zero cause binary minus)


user root have not any permission uid =0



special permission: on excution file -x set
--- = 010 or 001 or 100 
100 or 4 or suid is on - rwsrwxrwx - just owner can excute - other x is fake -4755 -u+s
010 or 2 or sgid is on - rwxrwsrwx 0 just group owner can excute -2755  - g+s
001 or 1 or sticky bit is on - just on directory - rwxrwxrwt - delet , write , rm ,... just owner can do it - /tmp have this permission its public directory  - o+t
