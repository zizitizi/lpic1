##### user and group permission

delet user from a group 
gpasswd -d username groupname

userdel username -g

passwd - change user pass - root can change all user pass 
gpasswd  - change group pass - for afministrative purpose

getent passwd arash - retrive inf from /etc/passwd
getent groups docker =cat /etc/group|grep docker retrive inf from /etc/group

chage -l arash - pass expire


ls -l - list of file with permission

file type: 
d- directory
-  - file
l- link - shortcut in windows - hardlink softlink
c - character device
b- block device
s- socket
P-named pip


#### permission level: permission class - user group other =ugo  +/- permission(rwx)
file - rwxrwxrwx - rwx means -read write run as app
dir -  rwxrwxrwx - rwx means -ls  ,cp mkdir ,.. , cd

chmod - change modification permission

w- is vital permission for file- is default
x- is vital permission for directory- is default
chmod ugo+x = chmod a+x = chmod +x

- permission parent is important than child - is for dir but there is -R is for recursive


permission class with binary - rwxrwxrwx =4+2+1 4+2+1 4+2+1 =777 - full permission

###### special permission
if 0 is not- 

stat file1 - full permission list


root and sudoer can:
chown - change ownershio - user and group owner
chgrp - change ownershio - just group owner

sudo chown zeintiz:docker chawnzizitozeintiz = sudo chown zeintiz.docker chawnzizitozeintiz - chown user,:group , user:group --recursive or -R for all content of directory


##### set default permission for users

umask - 

umask(not) and 666 - for file permission
umask(not) and 777 - for directory permission


or 


base permission for file(666)-umask=final permission for file
base permission for dir(777)-umask=final permission for dir

umask for users default = 002
umask for root default = 022

666-077=600 (-is zero cause binary minus)


user root have not any permission uid =0



special permission: on excution file -x set
--- = 010 or 001 or 100 
100 or 4 or suid is on - rwsrwxrwx - just owner can excute - other x is fake -4755 -u+s
010 or 2 or sgid is on - rwxrwsrwx 0 just group owner can excute -2755  - g+s
001 or 1 or sticky bit is on - just on directory - rwxrwxrwt - delet , write , rm ,... just owner can do it - /tmp have this permission its public directory  - o+t



#### links
hard link - shortcut - just one file is save on harddisk and other link point to it - one link change make others change - file when there is not link its really remove- when we make file we create hardlink - should be on same harddisk and partiorion - all hardlinks have same inode- hardlink just file.
ln file2 path/hlink1 - make hard link to file2
find / -samefile file4-new - find hardlink

or 
ls -li file4-new - see that file inode number
find / -inum 4541212 - find base on file inode number

df -h   - check partiotion
lsblk -  gheck partition tree

inode - table index for meta - sys attr and not seen - is unique for everyfile- it can make disk usage full solution for delete inode is .gz that file or move that file. change inode and delete older- change phisical place or zip - to see inode:
stat file1.txt
ls -li

how many link in directory. we can not make hardlink to dir - system do this - . , .. , subdirectory

soft (symbolic) or symlink - file or directory - every hard or partition - delet or rename orginal file delete everything - symlink dont have same inode- same as windows shortcut file

ln -s complete_path_to_fileordir newpath
ln --symlink
ln --symboliclink

blue link is corect link - red failed link

softlink size is number of path character and vary and just referal to path - but in windows is fix size

find / -type l  - find all link check to find our symlink

grep hello /tmp/file4
or
cat /tmp/file4 | grep hello

ls -li file4 - to see inode file4
