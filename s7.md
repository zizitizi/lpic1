# <b> manage process of system </b>

## <i>top</i>
top is realtime  taskmanager of proceess system status

in top every key has a meaning. for example: press h for help or press k for kill process. z z for color ,....

cpu usage = total cpu(s) - amount of ideal 


## free 
just represent ram usage
free -h - human readable


## gibi ,Tib , 
Gib ---> 1024 Mib
Gb --->1000Mb

1Tib --->1000Gb
1Tb--->910 Gibi



## <u>cpu</u>
 lscpu
 cat /proc/cpuinfo

we use load test to find amount of cpu cores.


## memory
cat /proc/meminfo
watch -d cat /proc/meminfo

## ps
process snapshot
ps -f --> full format listing
ps -ef --> every process of system full format listing - momentary snapshot but top is realtime snapshot
ex:
ps -ef |grep bzip2 ==pgrep bzip2 

PPID  - parent process id
PID - (child) process id
kill ppid - killed all pid
kill pid - no affect to parent and other ( child ) pid
what is frist process of system id? its init and its PID=1


## copy paste
ctrl+insert - copy
shift+insert - paste


## w
connected terminal --> tty=console , pts=ssh console

## htop
more user freindly top.
in button section shows help keys


## btop
snap insatll btop
is user freindly and arrow key help in button right 

# <b>linux signal</b>
use to kill process 

kill -l - list of kill signal is 64 
32 of that is predefinded  other is for schadule


--------
SIGTERM(15) - terminate  process with cleanup - default signal for kill command
SIGINT(2) - interupt signal same as 15 but used for kill with cleanup with ctrl+c
SIGKILL(9) - kill without cleanup - kill -9 PID = imediatle stop when linux is hanged- is most powerful signal- can not clean uncomplete file like zip files
SIG(1) - hangup when session is closed sends to all process


## kill 
kill pid -  kill that process
pkill processname - not recomand may affect all process with simillar name

killall PID - kill process tree with its parents

jobs(commands) with & - send to background

list background jobs:
jobs

send job to forground:
fg %[background job id]

ctrl+Z - stop and suspent and sent to background

bg %[background job id]- run process in back ground

kill %[background job id]- kill in background


## nohup

nohup ping 8.8.8.8 &
take ping stdout to nohup.out in curent directory then when session is closed process is not hungup


tail -f ping 8.8.8.8


to kill it
ps -ef | grep ping
kill -9 PID(notPPID- becarefull)


all jobs depends on session but nohup is solution
 when use nohup init is parent of that job
becarefull to use more than 1 process make that file mixed log - use different directory to run commands with nohup or use:
nohup somecammands &> nohup2.out &

in linus suspend same as sleep in windows but dont have hybernate default then dont use it


### apt install resource
 to see resource list:
 cat /etc/apt/sources.list  - this is afficial repo that we dont change it.
 apt update - make app and versions list update- repo update
apt upgarade - make all app upgrade

to add third party app repo add do this:
 cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  - in this directory we could add app repo one by one ex.: docker.list
