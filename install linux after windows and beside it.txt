1- first of all i download linux 22.04 lts ubuntu desktop iso image in my pc
2- free up sidk space for linux ubuntu installation i free up 360 g 

3- download rufus
4- open up rufus as administrator after that connect my usb device.

note : in my case rufus can not recogniza my usb device after i  try Alt-F in Rufus, which does the same to enable detection of fixed disks/hard drives. 
 
5- after detect i brows it to my linux iso - set boot selection on gpt and start but i got error in restart mode - then i set boot selection mbr or uefi. its work like a charm. wait for rufus to make my bootable usb device

6- in windows go to start type advnced startup option and restart in that window select usb device and follow instruction


7- after linux boot up hang on instruction but choose something else option in installation type. in hard partitioning i click on + and make swap partion boot ,/,home partition.

   root: ubuntu and modules install on this partition
   Home: users home directiory
   Swap: temprory ram data
   Boot: ubuntu boot file system
   
as you need you can revert everything
