1- first of all i download linux 22.04 lts ubuntu desktop iso image in my pc

2- download rufus
3- open up rufus as administrator after that connect my usb device.

note : in my case rufus can not recogniza my usb device after i  try Alt-F in Rufus, which does the same to enable detection of fixed disks/hard drives. 
 
4- after detect i brows it to my linux iso - set boot selection on gpt and start
