# <b> manage process of system </b>

## <i>top</i>
top is realtime  taskmanager of proceess system status

in top every key has a meaning. for example: press h for help or press k for kill process. z z for color ,....

cpu usage = total cpu(s) - amount of ideal 


## free 
just represent ram usage
free -h - human readable


## gibi ,Tib , 
Gib ---> 1024 Mib
Gb --->1000Mb

1Tib --->1000Gb
1Tb--->910 Gibi



## <u>cpu</u>
 lscpu
 cat /proc/cpuinfo

we use load test to find amount of cpu cores.


## memory
cat /proc/meminfo
watch -d cat /proc/meminfo

## ps
process snapshot
ps -f --> full format listing
ps -ef --> every process of system full format listing - momentary snapshot but top is realtime snapshot
ex:
ps -ef |grep bzip2 ==pgrep bzip2 

PPID  - parent process id
PID - (child) process id
kill ppid - killed all pid
kill pid - no affect to parent and other ( child ) pid
what is frist process of system id? its init and its PID=1


## copy paste
ctrl+insert - copy
shift+insert - paste


## w
connected terminal --> tty=console , pts=ssh console

## htop
more user freindly top.
in button section shows help keys


## btop
snap insatll btop
is user freindly and arrow key help in button right 

# <b>linux signal</b>
use to kill process 

kill -l - list of kill signal is 64 
32 of that is predefinded  other is for schadule


--------
SIGTERM(15) - terminate  process with cleanup - default signal for kill command
SIGINT(2) - interupt signal same as 15 but used for kill with cleanup with ctrl+c
SIGKILL(9) - kill without cleanup - kill -9 PID = imediatle stop when linux is hanged- is most powerful signal- can not clean uncomplete file like zip files
SIG(1) - hangup when session is closed sends to all process


## kill 
kill pid -  kill that process
pkill processname - not recomand may affect all process with simillar name

killall PID - kill process tree with its parents

jobs(commands) with & - send to background

list background jobs:
jobs

send job to forground:
fg %[background job id]

ctrl+Z - stop and suspent and sent to background

bg %[background job id]- run process in back ground

kill %[background job id]- kill in background


## nohup

nohup ping 8.8.8.8 &
take ping stdout to nohup.out in curent directory then when session is closed process is not hungup


tail -f ping 8.8.8.8


to kill it
ps -ef | grep ping
kill -9 PID(notPPID- becarefull)


all jobs depends on session but nohup is solution
 when use nohup init is parent of that job
becarefull to use more than 1 process make that file mixed log - use different directory to run commands with nohup or use:
nohup somecammands &> nohup2.out &

in linus suspend same as sleep in windows but dont have hybernate default then dont use it


### apt install resource
 to see resource list:
 cat /etc/apt/sources.list  - this is afficial repo that we dont change it.
 apt update - make app and versions list update- repo update
apt upgarade - make all app upgrade

to add third party app repo add do this:
 cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  - in this directory we could add app repo one by one ex.: docker.list
 when we add a repo to list we sould sign that to verify it. cause in update repo command just all verified app update. for sign use gpg key . download it in keyrings folder and give its adress in beside url in that file.
to make repo use that app installation guide in linux.

 \ comand means this line continoue in new line
 
 
### tee 
make tee shape stdout - file and command screen - its overwrite but we use -a to append new line
 echo "heloo teee T" | tee filetee.txt  - make filetee.txt and screen out put
 


### curl

client for url - link for downlod. or if it was web page cat it code:
 curl https://www.yahoo.com
 curl -fsSL https://www.yahoo.com  - f for ignore fail -s silent download -S show error -L show list
 
### wget
command line download manager for linux
wget downloadlink.deb  - download start - can continue even if connection reset.

if we dont have internet to install apt use one of this option:
- dkpg
- local repo
- ssh tunnel to shared pc for ex. your laptop- dynamic port forwarding in datacenter 


### install with dpkg and .deb file
dkpg is low level install app. cant find prequisit for apps we should do manual for prequisit.
then we use apt ( high level install manager) with ./ .for ex.:
apt install ./skype.deb  - then first of all find prequisit and instal from net then install skype
deb - dkpg (apt)  - dkpg -i file.deb   -installation  - dkpg -U file.deb  - for upgrade
RHEL - rpm - rpm -i file.rpm   -installation  - rpm -U file.deb  - for upgrade

dpkg -iv skype.deb 

### make local repo - offline repo - forward proxy - proxy server :

in this case we should change afficial ubuntu source.list to use local repo
nexus - jfrog 


# <b>network</b>
2 generation command : 1- ifconfig 2-ip  . that ip is newer version of ifconfig


net-tools ------> ifconfig - nslookup - route - netstat
ip--------------> ip addr - ip route 

eth0 --->ens0 in new linux - ethernet network system
veth - virtual ethernet 


## ifconfig
apt install net-tools

ifconfig - show network adapter info 

ifconfig -a - show all even disabled

ifconfig ens33 up/down - up or down ens33
if config ens33 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up  - overwrite ip

## ip
ip is same as find is Exception command couse its a function that could be use in short term ex. a or ad or addr or.. inplace of address - CIDR with /



ip address show 
ip link set ens33 up/down
ip address add 10.10.10.1/16 dev ens33  - append ip 
ip address del 10.10.10.1/16 dev ens33  - delete ip 
ip link set ens33 promisc on/off
every network cammand go to ram we should it permanet by .yml file

#### promisc (promisceuse)

its for packet sniffing- server that promisc that can recieve all packet in that network- it use for pentest - after activing it we should capture packet with wireshark or tshark or tcpdump(linux default) and export it- 

ifconfig ens33 promisc - it active promisc
if config ens33 -promisc  - it deactive promisc

#### subinterface

to assign muitiple ip address to one interface:
ifconfig ens33:0 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0 up - to create subinterface with number0
ifconfig ens33:0 down - to delete sub interface with name ens33:0


 sudo ip address add 192.168.13.1/24 dev ens33 label ens33:3
 ip adrr del 192.168.13.1/24 dev ens33 label ens33:3
 
 ### routing table 
 route -n
 netstat -rn
 ip route show
