# <b> manage process of system </b>

## <i>top</i>
top is realtime  taskmanager of proceess system status

in top every key has a meaning. for example: press h for help or press k for kill process. z z for color ,....

cpu usage = total cpu(s) - amount of ideal 


## free 
just represent ram usage
free -h - human readable


## gibi ,Tib , 
Gib ---> 1024 Mib
Gb --->1000Mb

1Tib --->1000Gb
1Tb--->910 Gibi



## <u>cpu</u>
 lscpu
 cat /proc/cpuinfo

we use load test to find amount of cpu cores.


## memory
cat /proc/meminfo
watch -d cat /proc/meminfo

## ps
process snapshot
ps -f --> full format listing
ps -ef --> every process of system full format listing - momentary snapshot but top is realtime snapshot
ex:
ps -ef |grep bzip2 ==pgrep bzip2 

PPID  - parent process id
PID - (child) process id
kill ppid - killed all pid
kill pid - no affect to parent and other ( child ) pid
what is frist process of system id? its init and its PID=1


## copy paste
ctrl+insert - copy
shift+insert - paste


## w
connected terminal --> tty=console , pts=ssh console

## htop
more user freindly top.
in button section shows help keys


## btop
snap insatll btop
is user freindly and arrow key help in button right 

# <b>linux signal</b>
use to kill process 

kill -l - list of kill signal is 64 
32 of that is predefinded  other is for schadule


--------
SIGTERM(15) - terminate  process with cleanup - default signal for kill command
SIGINT(2) - interupt signal same as 15 but used for kill with cleanup with ctrl+c
SIGKILL(9) - kill without cleanup - kill -9 PID = imediatle stop when linux is hanged- is most powerful signal- can not clean uncomplete file like zip files
SIG(1) - hangup when session is closed sends to all process


## kill 
kill pid -  kill that process
pkill processname - not recomand may affect all process with simillar name

killall PID - kill process tree with its parents

jobs(commands) with & - send to background

list background jobs:
jobs

send job to forground:
fg %[background job id]

ctrl+Z - stop and suspent and sent to background

bg %[background job id]- run process in back ground

kill %[background job id]- kill in background


## nohup

nohup ping 8.8.8.8 &
take ping stdout to nohup.out in curent directory then when session is closed process is not hungup


tail -f ping 8.8.8.8


to kill it
ps -ef | grep ping
kill -9 PID(notPPID- becarefull)


all jobs depends on session but nohup is solution
 when use nohup init is parent of that job
becarefull to use more than 1 process make that file mixed log - use different directory to run commands with nohup or use:
nohup somecammands &> nohup2.out &

in linus suspend same as sleep in windows but dont have hybernate default then dont use it


### apt install resource
 to see resource list:
 cat /etc/apt/sources.list  - this is afficial repo that we dont change it.
 apt update - make app and versions list update- repo update
apt upgarade - make all app upgrade

to add third party app repo add do this:
 cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  - in this directory we could add app repo one by one ex.: docker.list
 when we add a repo to list we sould sign that to verify it. cause in update repo command just all verified app update. for sign use gpg key . download it in keyrings folder and give its adress in beside url in that file.
to make repo use that app installation guide in linux.

 \ comand means this line continoue in new line
 
 
### tee 
make tee shape stdout - file and command screen - its overwrite but we use -a to append new line
 echo "heloo teee T" | tee filetee.txt  - make filetee.txt and screen out put
 


### curl

client for url - link for downlod. or if it was web page cat it code:
 curl https://www.yahoo.com
 curl -fsSL https://www.yahoo.com  - f for ignore fail -s silent download -S show error -L show list
 
### wget
command line download manager for linux
wget downloadlink.deb  - download start - can continue even if connection reset.

if we dont have internet to install apt use one of this option:
- dkpg
- local repo
- ssh tunnel to shared pc for ex. your laptop- dynamic port forwarding in datacenter 


### install with dpkg and .deb file
dkpg is low level install app. cant find prequisit for apps we should do manual for prequisit.
then we use apt ( high level install manager) with ./ .for ex.:
apt install ./skype.deb  - then first of all find prequisit and instal from net then install skype
deb - dkpg (apt)  - dkpg -i file.deb   -installation  - dkpg -U file.deb  - for upgrade
RHEL - rpm - rpm -i file.rpm   -installation  - rpm -U file.deb  - for upgrade

dpkg -iv skype.deb 

### make local repo - offline repo - forward proxy - proxy server :

in this case we should change afficial ubuntu source.list to use local repo
nexus - jfrog 


# <b>network</b>
2 generation command : 1- ifconfig 2-ip  . that ip is newer version of ifconfig


net-tools ------> ifconfig  - route - netstat - nslookup
ip--------------> ip addr - ip route -ss  - 

eth0 --->ens0 in new linux - ethernet network system
veth - virtual ethernet 


## ifconfig
apt install net-tools

ifconfig - show network adapter info 

ifconfig -a - show all even disabled

ifconfig ens33 up/down - up or down ens33
if config ens33 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up  - overwrite ip

## ip
ip is same as find is Exception command couse its a function that could be use in short term ex. a or ad or addr or.. inplace of address - CIDR with /



ip address show 
ip link set ens33 up/down
ip address add 10.10.10.1/16 dev ens33  - append ip 
ip address del 10.10.10.1/16 dev ens33  - delete ip 
ip link set ens33 promisc on/off
every network cammand go to ram we should it permanet by .yml file

#### promisc (promisceuse)

its for packet sniffing- server that promisc that can recieve all packet in that network- it use for pentest - after activing it we should capture packet with wireshark or tshark or tcpdump(linux default) and export it- 

ifconfig ens33 promisc - it active promisc
if config ens33 -promisc  - it deactive promisc

#### subinterface

to assign muitiple ip address to one interface:
ifconfig ens33:0 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0 up - to create subinterface with number0
ifconfig ens33:0 down - to delete sub interface with name ens33:0


 sudo ip address add 192.168.13.1/24 dev ens33 label ens33:3
 ip adrr del 192.168.13.1/24 dev ens33 label ens33:3
 
 ### routing table 
 route -n  - recommand table show -*******
 netstat -rn
 ip route show
 ip r
 
 
 
 
 low metric high priority use in same dest and same metric flag is important priority with G or gateway or something we assigned adminstrativley or manually add.
 
 no difference beetween to:
 to add static route with ip range:
 route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 ens33
 route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 gw 192.168.1.1 ens33
 ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 ens33  - that recommand ********
 route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 ens33
 
 
 to add static route with single ip :
 route add -host 192.168.1.3 gw 192.168.1.1 ens33
 route add -net 192.168.1.3/24 gw 192.168.1.1 ens33
 ip route add 192.168.1.3/24 via 192.168.1.1 ens33  - that recommand ********
 
 
 ip route del  192.168.1.3/24 dev ens33
 
 route add default gw 192.168.1.1
 ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
 
 
 
 ### how to make network setting change permanent
 write configuration in config file in :
 /etc/netplan    - ubuntu debian family . its different in other ex.: redhat also  in older ubuntu is different - in redhat go to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts files: ifcfg-ens33 , ifcfg-eth0 , route-ens33...
 
 vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml  - write configuration in this file make it permanent
 
 
 network:
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: true
    ens37:
      dhcp4: false
      addresses:
      - 192.168.2.1/24
      - 172.45.16.2/24
      - 10.10.10.100/16
      #gateway:        
      #- 192.168.2.2
      nameservers:
        addresses:
        - 192.168.1.2
        - 192.168.1.1
        - 8.8.8.8
      routes:
      - to: 0.0.0.0/0 
        via 192.168.2.2
      - to: 192.168.1.0/24
        via: 192.168.1.2
      - to: 172.45.16.0/24  
      - to:10.10.10.100/16
  version: 2

version 2 everytime we should write this
if dhcp4 is false we should set ip addresses and gateway4 and nameservers routes (to and optionally via) manually- but gateway4 is depricated instead we should write default route to 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.168.2.2


after save that yaml file hit:
netplan apply   - all older config delete and overwrite with this
systemctl restart network - dont use it becouase make down all networks for For a moments.


 ### yaml - data serialization language ex.: xml,json,yaml,...- config file language -syntax and rules- yaml is json without {} and[]
 
   (# is description. maybe end of opne command line)
 in string if have special character then you should use "" 
 one space two space - 2 space for object attribute below an abject and use dash for first
 boolean value: true/false - yes/no - on/off - 
 for list use  [a,b,...] or
 - a
 - b ,,
 
 2 yaml file in one use --- (3 dash)as saperator
 
 use - dash and space for attr and no dash just two space for sub object
 
## ping 

ping 8.8.8.8
ping -c 3  8.8.8.8 - ping send 3 packet
ping -s 10  8.8.8.8 - set packet size to 10 byte but ping send 10+8 (headerandfooter) to dest - to bandwitdh test 
ping -I ens33 -c 2 8.8.8.8 - ping via specified interface - get ping from source 
ping -i 5 -c 2 8.8.8.8 - ping in 5 second intervals two packet

ping -6 ::1  - ping with ip version6 loopback interface
ping6 ::1  - same as above command 
(in ip version6 ::1 is loopback or local host same as 127.0.0.1 in ip v4)

sudo ip route del default via 10.10.10.0 - delete wrong default route

## traceroute

tracepath google.com - trace route to goole.com . use to tshoot beetween router and site - linux default
apt install traceroute  - install traceroute ( windows same app)
traceroute google.com
traceroute -n google.com - no resoled host name just ip route show
traceroute -i ens33 google.com - ping via specified interface
traceroute -p 32 google.com - ping sends from this port
traceroute -I google.com - send packet via icmpv4.(Linux traceroute sends UDP packets.)
traceroute6 ::1  - use for ip6
traceroute -6 ::1  - use for ip6

## netstat or SS
display current network connections
netstat -pentual
ss -pentual
